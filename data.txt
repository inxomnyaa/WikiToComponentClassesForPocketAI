== Filters ==

: Filters allow data objects to specify test critera which allows their use.

: For example, a model that includes a filter will only be used when the filter criteria is true.

: A typical filter consists of four paramters:

: name: the name of the test to apply.

: domain: the domain the test should be performed in. An armor slot, for example. This parameter is only used by a few tests.

: operator: the comparison to apply with the value, such as 'equal' or 'greater'.

: value: the value being compared with the test.

: A typical filter looks like the following:

: { "test" : "moon_intensity", "subject" : "self", "operator" : "greater", "value" : "0.5" }

: Which results in the calling entity (self) calculating the moon_intensity at its location and returning true if the result is greater than 0.5.

: Tests can be combined into groups using the collections 'all_of' and 'any_of'.

: All tests in an 'all_of' group must pass in order for the group to pass.

: One or more tests in an 'any_of' group must pass in order for the group to pass.

: Example:

: "all_of" : [

:   { "test" : "moon_intensity", "subject" : "self", "operator" : "greater", "value" : "0.5" },

:   { "test" : "in_water", "subject" : "target", "operator" : "equal", "value" : "true" }

: ]

: This filter group will pass only when the moon_intensity is greater than 0.5 AND the caller's target entity is standing in water.

=== clock_time ===
